# Contributing to It Starts with Clojure

The project is very open for contributions and all contributors are welcomed with open arms.
If you feel like contributing to this project there is few ways that can be done.
Additionally, if you come up with other helpful ways, don't be afraid to suggest your approach.

## How to contribute

### Easy way: Fixing issues

The easiest way to contribute to the project is by solving issues.
There are many kinds of issues available in the project ranging from:
"I don't have time for this for now" to "I can't do this by myself".
Feel free to choose any of the open issues and get your hands dirty.

### Fast way: Creating new issues

It sounds bad, but it is not.
We love issues. They are a great way to communicate flaws, needs and ideas.

If you find a mistake, but don't have time to fix it. Create an issue.

If you find a bug, but don't know how to fix it. Create an issue.

If you find part, section or chapter confusing or misleading. Create an issue.

If you think we are generally missing an important topic. Create an issue.

### Creative way: Creating practice projects

I sometimes have hard time coming up with interesting and educational case projects.
If you think you have a cool idea for a project that the course could cover in order to learn valuable lessons,
you can create pull request of such a project.

Place your project idea into *it-starts-with-clojure/projects/*

If the project fits the course, I will try to embed it into the materials and write chapters around it.

Please note that writing instructions for the code takes much more time than writing the code,
thus i might not be able to do this immediately.

### Punctual way: Fixing typos and proof reading

This is a bit personal, but I have light dyslexia. Even though I use plugins to check for typos,
they still sometimes slip in.

Secondly, I am not a native speaker and I write rather fast,
thus I make mistakes and/or just write weirdly.

In both of these cases I invite you to help me to make this guide better by fixing my mistakes.
If you see issues like this, feel free to fix the and make pull request.

## All help is always welcome

Regardless how you contribute, I welcome your assistance.
I never intended this guide to be a solo project,
thus I really hope there is others who are interested in this sort of projects.
