# Welcome to the Close Your Parens -guide

Currently available chapters are:

## [1. First Things First](./1-first-things-first)

A section that will guide you through all annoying stuff like installations and such.
Some introductions to the guide itself are also provided.
All of this should be very brief.

## [2. Little bit of REPL](./2-little-bit-of-repl)

Introduction to Clojure's arguably most powerful feature in Clojure.
Learn it first and learn it well and it will guide you through all sorts of adventures.

## [3. Your first Project](./3-first-project)

We will learn how to create functions and build simple Clojure applications.
In the progress we will learn how perform basic I/O operations with Clojure.
