# Little bit of REPL

In this chapter you will get a first touch with the Clojure itself.
We will create a sandbox project and play with REPL.
Also we will start building up the knowledge on the language itself.
Some things might feel like they are hanging out without too much context,
but bare with us.
This is just to let you know these things exist,
so we can cover more interesting topics more easily in the following chapters.

## [1. Leiningen 101](./1-leiningen-101.md)

In this section we will create your first Clojure project with Leiningen.
You will be able to use this project later for trying out things and such.
You can use this project as scratch paper type of thing after wards.

## [2. Using REPL](./2-using-repl.md)

Here we will get familiar with how to use REPL,
your new best friend.
This is critical for the future adventures.

## [3. Hands on REPL](./3-hands-on-repl.md)

We get more hands on with REPL.
Also will cover some basic Arithmetic functions and basic data types.

## Recap

After this chapter you should:

- Be able to create Clojure Projects with Leiningen

- Be familiar with to use REPL from both Command Line and IDE

- Be able to call existing Clojure functions

- Have a basic knowledge of Arithmetic functions in Clojure

- Have knowledge of basic data types in Clojure
