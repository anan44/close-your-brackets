# Final Words

First of all I wish to congratulate you dear reader.
You have made it all the way to the end of this guide/course/what-ever-this-is!

Secondly I would like to thank you for letting me be part of beginning of your awesome journey to Clojure.
I hope you will soon get to write Clojure to production!
That is when your learning really starts and you will start to see the power of this language.
If that does not happen,
it is still possible to take a lot of good ideas, patterns & practices from Clojure let them influence how you generally write code in any language.

I personally believe that every programming language we learn makes us better programmer with all the languages we use.
Each language has their unique set of ideas and their way of approaching things.
Many of these ideas are not language dependent and can easily be utilized in other languages as well.

When I started writing this thing,
I was rather novice with Clojure
I had not written any production Clojure that point,
but I had read bunch of books about the language.
That being said it is not anywhere the same as writing production code with it.
Soon after starting to do this thing I got an opportunity to write a lot Clojure for living.

## Thoughts on teaching

Dear reader:

In case you ever want to learn a new language or a technology,
I highly recommend you to teach it to others.
I have now taught Clojure to people online and offline,
and without a doubt I can vouch that it is a wonderful way to enforce your own understanding of any technology.

Teaching forces your to reorganize your thoughts and look deeper into how things actually work. Without doing this teaching is not possible. But luckily this kind of happens by itself when we teach others.

## Future progress of this project

I will keep on maintaining this project for the forseeable future,
but I do not intend to add new content.

That being said,
I will keep on making fixes and minor additions nevertheless!
So in case you notice any issues with the content,
I would kindly ask you to create an issue to github,
that way I will know something requires fixing.
Pull requests are of course appreciated as well!

## Thanks for all the help!

I would like to give a special thanks to all the people who have raised issues with this course and written pull requests!

Your help has been much appreciated!
