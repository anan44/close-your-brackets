# Your first project - Sum 'em up

Since this is a __PRACTICAL__ guide to Clojure,
it is time to get out of new found safety of REPL and build something real!

In this chapter we will build a simple application that:

1. Read numbers from a file

2. Sums the numbers up

3. Prints the numbers to command line

This might and does sound extremely trivial,
but in the progress we will learn plenty of useful skills.
Further more we will immediately connect Clojure to real world,
which might often feel hard to get started with.

## Recap

Among other things after this chapter you:

- Know how to create (a.k.a. define) new functions.

- Are able to perform basic I/O operations with Clojure

- Can build a runnable Clojure application
