# Your first project - Sum 'em up

Since this is a __PRACTICAL__ guide to Clojure,
it is time to get out of new found safety of REPL and build something real!

In this chapter we will build a simple application that:

1. Read numbers from a file

2. Sums the numbers up

3. Prints the numbers to command line

This might and does sound extremely trivial,
but in the progress we will learn plenty of useful skills.
Further more we will immediately connect Clojure to real world,
which might often feel hard to get started with.

## [1. Minimum Viable Product](./1-minimum-viable-product.md)

Here we will create the version that barely meets standards of our software.
Aim is to make just some thing that works,
so we can improve it later.

## [2. Running and Building with Leiningen](./2-running-and-building-with-leiningen.md)

This part will teach us how to run code from command line with Leiningen.
After that we will look into building and running runnables.

## Recap

Among other things after this chapter you:

- Know how to create (a.k.a. define) new functions.

- Are able to perform basic operations in Clojure. Such as:
  - Reading from file.
  - Parsing text.
  - Parsing numbers from a text.
  - Operations to whole collection with map and apply
  - Basic Java interop

- Can run Clojure applications from command line

- Can build a runnable Clojure application
