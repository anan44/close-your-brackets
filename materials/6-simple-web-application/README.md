# Simple web application

In this chapter we will be focusing on the thing that Clojure really shines on.
Web applications.
And it is easy to say that web development with Clojure is just amazing.
This is mainly due two factors:
Functional programming is a really good fit with web development,
and Clojure ecosystem rather well geared towards the web development.

There is many ways to build a Clojure web application.
Unlike in many other languages,
in Clojure it is popular to build web application from scatch without use of an existing framework.
Most other languages have their goto web framework (like Spring, Ruby On Rails, Django),
but in Clojure relying on such a framework is not as common,
and we tend to see more modular web application patched together from various components.
